# BeOS-Dano-Headers
A collection of headers included in the leaked BeOS 5.1 Dano copy. This is here for pure convenience...

# Notice
These headers were included in a leaked version of BeOS codenamed "Dan0".
If you are the owner of the BeOS assests and would like me to take these down, please let me know.
Of course, because of this, no pull requests are allowed, and the code here is technically under a proprietary license.
